RPI DHT22 SERVER
----------------

This project contains necessarry files and scripts to read temperature and 
humidity data from a DHT22 sensor, wired to a Raspberry Pi 4. It stores the 
results every 2 seconds in a local Sqlite database, and renders them on a bare 
simple frontend using ChartJS powered by Flask.

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev \
        libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev
    wget https://python.org/ftp/python/3.12.1/Python-3.12.1.tgz
    tar -xf Python-3.12.1.tgz 
    cd Python-3.12.1
    ./configure --enable-optimizations
    sudo make altinstall

Create a Python virtual environment and install the Python dependencies 
(this is a one-off command)

    make venv deps

USAGE
-----

Run the dht sensor polling service
    
    make polling

From another terminal window, run the flask server
